# Kinesis-1D-CNN
This repo contains the trained 1D CNN model, as well as the code to train your own model, for [Neurosity's kinesis EEG data set](https://github.com/neurosity/sw-kinesis-ai). The trained model within this repo has markedly better accuracy than Neurosity's random forrest model for the same data setâ€”89.45% compared to 81.2%. Additionally, the vast majority of the missclassifications are miss of rest state labels. This more or less makes sense as people's thoughts may tend to wander a little more when "at rest" data was being gathered compared to when envisioning motor functions.
